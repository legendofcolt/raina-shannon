      While working on our web application’s investment alert capability, I had an opportunity to work with the team in charge of our product’s companion  mobile app. The app is in its infancy, and needed a bit of UX direction to ingest a workflow in a mobile-friendly way that wasn’t necessarily addressed by our desktop framework.
      In addition, we had to solve for a way to send push notifications or emails that didn’t expose any sensitive data outside our secure app, while still providing value by being clear what the notification was for.
